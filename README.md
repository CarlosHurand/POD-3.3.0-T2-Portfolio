# Team Portfolio Page 

A web page created while learning during MLH Production Engineering summer batch.

Started with a 1 week deadline and a team of 3 to make a web page using Flask to serve as a template for the rest of the program.

The next 7 weeks consisted of individual work on the base page made in the first week to have it running on AWS using tools like Docker, Nginx, SSL Certs, cadvisor, sqlite3, Git/Github, GitHub Actions, etc...

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed


Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template


Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
